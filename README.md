## File names and their functionality
- **walls.c** Opens up default browser on OS and goes to a funny youtube clip
- **ForceVisit.c** A better version of walls.c because now you can make the computer go to whatever URL you provide as a parameter
- **MouseStop.c** Stops the mouse from moving on windows (still needs to be compiled)
- **DisableLS.sh** Changes execution permission for ls command so no one can use it.
